# Cartoonify-Two

A better version of cartoonify-One, that takes an image and the number of clusters to be made as input.
The number of clusters is basically the number of colours(exact shades of colours) you need. for example, if the number of clusters is 1, then the image will only be made of one shade of one colour.

Example:
python quant.py --image PathForImage --clusters NumberOfClusters

The favourable number of clusters would be 8 to 16.
